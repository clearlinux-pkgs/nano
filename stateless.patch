+
+## Setup of syntax coloring.
+##
+## Format:
+##
+## syntax "short description" ["filename regex" ...]
+##
+## The "none" syntax is reserved; specifying it on the command line is
+## the same as not having a syntax at all.  The "default" syntax is
+## special: it takes no filename regexes, and applies to files that
+## don't match any other syntax's filename regexes.
+##
+## color foreground,background "regex" ["regex"...]
+## or
+## icolor foreground,background "regex" ["regex"...]
+##
+## "color" will do case-sensitive matches, while "icolor" will do
+## case-insensitive matches.
+##
+## Valid colors: white, black, red, blue, green, yellow, magenta, cyan.
+## For foreground colors, you may use the prefix "bright" to get a
+## stronger highlight.
+##
+## To use multi-line regexes, use the start="regex" end="regex"
+## [start="regex" end="regex"...] format.
+##
+## If your system supports transparency, not specifying a background
+## color will use a transparent color.  If you don't want this, be sure
+## to set the background color to black or white.
+##
+## All regexes should be extended regular expressions.
+##
+## If you wish, you may put your syntax definitions in separate files.
+## You can make use of such files as follows:
+##
+## include "/path/to/syntax_file.nanorc"
+##
+## Unless otherwise noted, the name of the syntax file (without the
+## ".nanorc" extension) should be the same as the "short description"
+## name inside that file.  These names are kept fairly short to make
+## them easier to remember and faster to type using nano's -Y option.
+##
+## To include all existing syntax definitions, you can do:
+# include "@PKGDATADIR@/*.nanorc"
+
+
+## Key bindings.
+## See nanorc(5) for more details on this.
+##
+## Here are a few samples to get you going.
+##
+# bind M-W nowrap main
+# bind M-A casesens search
+# bind ^S research main
+
+## Set this if your backspace key sends Del most of the time.
